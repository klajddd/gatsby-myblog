### Tech stack and tools used for this project:
- `HackerRank`
- `Java`
- `Python`
- `VS Code`
- `IntelliJ`

This article is an overview of how to prepare for programming challenges and exercises on competitive programming sites like HackerRank. 

You will need to have a basic understanding of the Big O notation used to measure a programs efficiency, and data structure and algorithm concepts such as:

- Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Heaps
    - Linked lists
    - Trees
    - Maps
    - Graphs

- Algorithms
    - Searching algorithms
        - Linear search
        - Binary search
        - Tree traversal
    - Sorting algorithms
        - Bubble sort
        - Insertion sort
        - Selection sort
        - Quick sort 
        - Merge sort
        - Tim sort
